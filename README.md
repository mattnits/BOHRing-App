### Description
At Laurier we had a website (https://bohr.wlu.ca/) that is becoming outdated where we can find a list of all Physics and Computer Science courses along with information about them. We decided to create an android app that takes this website and uses it a basis for a more modern and multifunctional app. We added the ability to add/remove classes, add items to the schedule, display things such as the syllabus in a more mobile friendly way and much more. Thus the BOHRing app was born!
